====================

There is many things I would like to do, but here is first step.

* EEG Monitor **rake monitor:eeg**
  It checks if MindWave is connected to the computer by connecting to ThinkGearConnector.
  It than reads EEG info and stores in table eeg_records.

## System dependencies:
    Tested on MacOS X
    MindWave Mobile by NeuroSky
